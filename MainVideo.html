    <h2>Dear May,</h2>
    <p>
      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter comes from the deepest part of my heart. I never anticipated that I would find myself falling for you so deeply. To be honest, I lost a lot of things this year, but having you just complete me. Looking back, I can pinpoint the moment it all began – the day we both got piercings in District 1. It was then that I realized I was drawn to you.
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that point on, we shared countless moments together navigating the highs and lows of life. I stood by your side during your moments of vulnerability, just as you supported me when I faced my own challenges. No matter how life gets hard, I choose to stay with you. I will try harder just to be with you, to care you , to love you , to get accepted from your parents. 
      <br>
     
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We've created a treasury of cherished memories together during these months – dancing, studying, going hangout , job searches, collaborative work, joint volunteering, late-night conversations, and shared swims. Whenever I'm with you, I experience a sense of liberation and contentment. I want to give you my everything because I genuinely believe that you deserve more than you realize. I vow to stand by you, shielding you from negativity.
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so into you, even you don't put any make up on your face, you are cute like a baby. When you are wearing a dress, you are gorgeous like a queen. Your smile alone paints a picture of beauty that words struggle to capture. Don't be insecure about you and do not try to be beautiful because you are the true Beauty. 
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Losing you is something I can't fathom. Know that I love you, "May,my pretty little girl" with all my heart. <br> <br> <br> This is the song that express my feeling the most.
